      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          My name is Gerry Singh! My journey began in a close-knit community,
          where I spent my childhood in a small village surrounded by vast, open
          spaces. The deep connections with family and the freedom of the
          outdoors shaped much of who I am today, influencing both my path and
          perspectives, and guiding me at every step of my journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, I'm navigating life as a third-year Computer Science student at
          Seattle Pacific University, diving deep into the world of tech. I love
          collaborating with like-minded individuals to explore new ideas and
          tackle complex problems. My passion for technology goes beyond just
          the classroom; I’m always seeking ways to challenge myself and push
          the boundaries of what’s possible.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Outside of the classroom, you'll find me spending time with my
          cousins, hitting the gym, or diving into my favorite video games.
          Music is a huge part of my life, I listen daily and occasionally get
          creative, writing my own songs to express my thoughts.
