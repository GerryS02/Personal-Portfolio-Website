      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          My name is Gerry Singh, and I was born and raised in the vibrant
          fields of Punjab, India, where I spent my childhood in a small village
          surrounded by vast, open spaces. The deep connections of family and
          the freedom of the outdoors shaped much of who I am today, influencing
          both my path and perspectives.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Now, I'm navigating life as a third-year Computer Science student at
          Seattle Pacific University, and I'm an active member of the CS club,
          where I connect with others who share my passion for tech.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of the classroom, you'll find me spending time with my
          cousins, hitting the gym, or diving into my favorite video games.
          Music is a huge part of my life, I listen daily and occasionally get
          creative, writing my own songs to express my thoughts.
